Prework Study Guide Webpage
Description
This is a simple website which utilizes HTML, JavaScript, Git, and CSS to show what I have learned so far in the bootcamp.

My motivation for this project was my desire to further my skillset and learn how to program.
I built this project in order to further my coding skills and to learn the fundementals of coding.
This problem this project solves is figuring out the basics of programming and the challenges that come with it.
I learned a lot about the way different programming languages work, and how to apply thme to a project.
